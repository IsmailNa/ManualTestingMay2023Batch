Build Verification Testing[Smoke Testing]
------------------------------------------
Testing of the most important areas.
If these areas are passing then only the build is eligible to go for in-depth testing

launching of the application url should not throw any 400 or 500 series errors
launching of the homepage or landingpage should happen within a stipulated amount of time
all the buttons and important WebElements of the webpage should be where they are supposed to be as per the design document

all the links and buttons and other important[business] areas of the webpage should be working as intended
---------------------------------------------------

Let's say Smoke Testing passes, now what ?? Sanity Testing

Smoke Testing is done to make sure the build received from the dev tema is testworthy for the next level or not
Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check the most important, important functionalities of the application. Smoke testing is like a Subset of Sanity Testing

Smoke Testing is done by both developers and Testers
but
Sanity Testing is only done by Testers

Smoke testing, the build may be stable or unstable
but
in Sanity Testing, the build is relatively very stable

Smoke Testing is part of basic testing
but 
Sanity Testing is part of in-depth regression Testing
