Advantages of WaterFall model
> Quality of the product will be very good
> Since requirement changes are not allowed, the chances of finding bugs are less.
> Initial investment is less since the testers are hired at later stages
> Preferred for smaller projects when requirements are completely signed off and freezed.


Disadvantages of Waterfall model
> Requirement changes are not allowed. So tecnically there is no room for compartmentalization.
> In the 1st stage there was a defect which could not be detected. 
> If there is a problem, cost of fix is much higher
> Testing can only start after coding is over.
